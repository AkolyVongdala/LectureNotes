    "The goal today is to take some of the ideas we've developed in the past few weeks, and do a couple things to make our lives easier:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define standalone functions which accomplish tasks that we would like to do repeatedly\n",
    "- Put these functions in a place where we can easily use them without copy-pasting repeatedly\n",
    "- Think about how to make our analysis reproducible – both for the sake of our future selves, and for the sake of anyone who wants to replicate and/or build on our work.\n",

    "2. Write functions which, given the zip file, will access the particular data that we would like to look at and return a pandas array.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - These functions should **not** extract the data to disk if possible (because some files are very big when uncompressed)\n",
    "   - These functions should take care of things like parsing dates, etc.\n",

    "3. Write a function which will group and join the trip and weather data into a single DataFrame, making use of the above functions.\n",
